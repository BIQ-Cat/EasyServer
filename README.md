# EasyServer

## A light multy-lingual framework written in Go

### Features
- Multi-lingual structure, so you can use many languages in one project with ease
- Customisable system: EasyServer can change it's structure for (and _with_) your project
- Source-based configuration, which can make your server faster, is JSON-styled, easy-to-learn and comes as a __default__ variant (it means you can _always_ replace it with a JSON variant)
- FastCGI is supported. (coming soon)

### Installation
On UNIX-based system:
```console
$ make build
```
In the `build` folder, you can see your compiled EasyServer and libraries.
